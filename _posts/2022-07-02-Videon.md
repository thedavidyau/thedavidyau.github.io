Videon was a web application that allowed users to subscribe, using real money, 
to a content creator's channel. By subscribing to a content creator's channel, 
it gave the user access to videos that they posted onto their channel. 
\
\
Videon was built using VueJS for the frontend design, Express for the backend web 
application, MongoDB to store data, Cloudinary for video hosting, and 
Paypal for the payment system. 
\
\
This web application was created for a course 
project by my partner and I, but is currently inactive.
