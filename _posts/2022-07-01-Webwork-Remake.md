For this project, my group and I were tasked to create a new homework/assessment application for a statistics professor at University of Toronto.
She wanted the application to be automated and easy to use for the students. 
\
\
We used Java for the frontend and backend, MySQL to store
student data and assessments and a bit of CSS to style the frontend. During the development of this application, we followed the Agile Software 
Development project management framework to plan and execute our ideas.
